  <h3 class="about-me-title">About Me</h3>

      <p class="about-me">I am a developer seeking a position with an innovative and creative team. One that works in a progressive and cooperative environment. Ideally, I would like to use my skills in something music related or in video game design, though I have other interests as well. </p>

    <p class="about-me-2">Being both a producer and DJ for House music myself, I am extremely passionate about music and would love to work with it on an even more technical level. As a creator and lover of music, I know what both the professionals and audiences desire in their interface, effects, and performance. Having the ability to influence the creation process of various music tools would open another door in exploring music to me. </p>

    <p class="about-me-3">Gaming has also been a passion of mine since I was a child, and I have always dreamed of taking part in the creation process. I would love having the opportunity to materialize my ideas and feel my experience as both a gamer and writer would help me excel in video game design.</p>
